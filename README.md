# boomcalc

boomcalc is a jQuery plugin that renders a simple, usable calculator on a DOM
element. It was developed as an exercise, and a bit of a learning project too.

## Usage

Once you include boomcalc (and jQuery) into your page, just:

	<div id="calc"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $('#calc').boomCalc(height: 300, width: 250);	
    </script> 

## One nice thing

boomcalc will scale its layout to meet any proportion specified. Of course,
some dimensions look better than others.
